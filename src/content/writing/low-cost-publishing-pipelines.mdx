# Building low-cost publishing pipelines (versioned content)

Publishing should feel like shipping. For retail menus and content-heavy catalogs, I rely on versioned payloads that can be generated, reviewed, and rolled back without custom admin tooling.

## What works

- Keep content serialized and versioned.
- Use cheap storage + CDN for distribution.
- Promote versions instead of editing live data.

## Why it matters

The approach reduces errors, makes changes auditable, and keeps publishing fast even for large catalogs.
