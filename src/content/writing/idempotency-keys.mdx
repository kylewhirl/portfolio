# Idempotency keys and why integrations fail in the real world

Integrations break when retries collide with side effects. Idempotency is the guardrail that keeps vendor APIs from double-charging, double-fulfilling, or double-creating customer data.

## The practical pattern

- Create a deterministic key for each action.
- Store it alongside the vendor call and result.
- On retries, return the original response without re-running the action.

## The payoff

When you combine idempotency with reconciliation jobs, you get a system that can retry safely and explain what happened later.
