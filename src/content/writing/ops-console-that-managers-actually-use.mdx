# Designing an internal ops console that managers actually use

I built the Vine Admin console after watching managers hop between point-of-sale dashboards, vendor tools, and spreadsheets just to keep daily operations moving. The goal wasn't another dashboard - it was a single surface that mirrored how work actually happens on the floor.

## What made it work

- Start with the workflow, not the data model.
- Keep the navigation shallow so a task always feels one-click away.
- Make visibility obvious: statuses, owners, and next actions live at the top.

## Outcomes

The console saved roughly 10 hours per week across two locations and helped keep a 6,500-bottle catalog accurate and online. It also became the natural place to add new workflows, because the team trusted it.
