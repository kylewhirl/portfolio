# Smart home integrations: reliability patterns that matter

Smart home UX falls apart when devices don't respond or states drift. The most important improvements are invisible: reconnect logic, debouncing, and event replay.

## Patterns I rely on

- Backoff on polling and honor vendor rate limits.
- Confirm state changes with device events when possible.
- Store last-known-good state for fast UI updates.

## The result

Devices feel native because they recover quickly and stay honest about what they can do.
